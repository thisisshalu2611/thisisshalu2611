# Hi there, I'm Shalu Gopinathan 👋

I am currently working with NextGen Clearing as a Business Analyst, a position I have held for the past 19 months. Prior to this, I was employed at Wipro as an Associate Data Analyst for 7 months. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from Ajeenkya DY Patil University (ADYPU), where I specialized in Mobile Application and Cloud Technology. Upon graduation, I was recruited by Verificient Technologies from campus and worked there as a Data Analyst for 15 months.

In addition to my professional experience, I have completed internships in data science and machine learning, further honing my analytical skills. Overall, I have accumulated over 3 years of experience in various analyst roles. Currently, I am pursuing an MBA with a focus on Business Analysis to deepen my expertise and broaden my skill set.

I am particularly fascinated by the field of product management and eager to explore opportunities in this area. Outside of work, I am passionate about reading and hiking, activities that help me stay balanced and inspired.
